## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ my name is Hila Nissan

âœ¨ Iâ€™m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University (BIU). My academic journey has exposed me to a wide range of programming languages, tools, and conceptsâ€”from mathematics and algorithms to data structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and computer architecture.

âœ¨ I'm deeply passionate about data science, machine learning, and constantly learning new things. Whether itâ€™s mastering new technologies or diving into completely new fields, Iâ€™m always eager to expand my horizons and apply what I learn to solve real-world problems.
